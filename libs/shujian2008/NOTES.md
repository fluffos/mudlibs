# shujian2008 — 「书剑天下」2008 (ShuJian MUD, 2008 build)

Archive: `书剑2008.rar`. Port: 40029. Status: **done** (boots clean, full
registration flow verified end-to-end including a real Chinese name and
correct rejection of a banned novel-character name).

## What this is

"「书剑天下」" ("ShuJian" / "Book and Sword, the World"), credited to
"ShuJian MUD Wizard Group", hosted at www.cqmud.com ("重庆电信" / Chongqing
Telecom). Same "Century-family" `adm/single/{master,simul_efun}` layout
as `shiji`/`zhonghua2` (archives #32/#34), but with a much more
elaborate, genuinely custom `securityd.lpc` ACL system (directory-based
`trusted_read`/`exclude_read` tables keyed by wizard-status categories)
rather than the simpler `find_object`-only pattern seen in those two —
this turned out to matter a great deal (see below). ~11,714 raw files,
9,936 after `.c`→`.lpc` rename.

## Fixes applied

### Standard §15h Chinese-detection fixes

1. `adm/simul_efun/chinese.lpc`'s `is_chinese()` — a two-specific-byte
   variant (`str[0]` lead-byte range 176-247, `str[1]` trail-byte range
   161-254, plus a reserved-codepoint exclusion for `str[0]==215 &&
   str[1]>249`) — rewritten to the standard single-character CJK
   codepoint check.
2. `adm/daemons/logind.lpc`'s `check_legal_name(object ob, string name)`
   — bound `i<4||i>8||i%2` (byte count, plus an odd-BYTE-count rejection
   that's meaningless for character counts) → `i<2||i>4`; removed the
   `i%2==0` even-byte-offset gate so every character position is
   checked; `name[i..<1]` (a multi-byte suffix, since the old `is_chinese`
   only read the first 2 bytes of whatever it was given) → `name[i..i]`
   (a clean single-character slice, matching the simplified
   single-character `is_chinese`).
3. `adm/daemons/named.lpc`'s `valid_name()` — a banned-substring double
   loop stepping over GBK byte-pair boundaries (`i/j += 2`, `j` starting
   at `i+1`) building substrings of whole 2-byte characters — rewritten
   to step per-character (`i++`/`j` starting at `i`, `j++`).

### Two new architectural bug classes (AGENTS.md §15n, §15o)

These aren't Chinese-detection bugs at all — they're driver-vs-custom-ACL
interaction bugs, and took by far the most diagnostic effort of any lib
this session. **See AGENTS.md §15n/§15o for the full writeup** (this is
the short version):

- **§15n**: this lib's real `securityd.lpc` denies `(player)`-status
  callers from reading `/adm` or `/cmds` at all — correct for actual
  data reads, but the driver ALSO routes compile-time source loading
  (`func=="load_object"`/`"recompile_object"`) and `#include` resolution
  (`func=="include"`) through this exact same `valid_read` gate, and a
  fresh pre-login connection defaults to `(player)` status. Every
  never-preloaded `/adm`/`/cmds` object's first lazy compile — triggered
  incidentally by the registration flow (`BAN_D`, then `UPTIME_CMD`,
  `mudlist`, `sited`, one at a time as each was reached) — crashed with
  "Read access denied" instead of just compiling. **Fixed by adding
  `case "load_object": case "recompile_object": case "include": return
  1;`** to `securityd.lpc`'s `valid_read` switch — compiling/including
  code is routine operation, never a sensitive data read, and should
  never be gated by the caller's status. Also preloaded `/adm/daemons/band`
  as a belt-and-suspenders first attempt (harmless to keep, though the
  securityd fix alone would have covered it).
- **§15o**: `master.lpc` never defined `get_include_path()` at all. Per
  the driver source, a compile with no VM context (preload, bare `lpcc
  --batch`) just uses the config's raw include path; a compile WITH a VM
  context (live, mid-connection, exactly this lib's registration flow)
  calls `master->get_include_path()` instead, and with no apply defined,
  no path gets resolved. Symptom looked identical to §15n at first (a
  compile error mid-registration) but was actually the NEXT layer once
  §15n let the underlying read through — "Cannot #include globals.h",
  a compile error, not "Read access denied", a runtime error. Fixed with
  the same `get_include_path()` shape already used in `es1_win`/`esI`
  (AGENTS.md §8d), returning `({ file's own directory, ":DEFAULT:" })`.
  **Caveat honestly noted**: once §15n's `"include"` case was in place,
  this specific symptom was gone before I got to retest §15o's fix in
  isolation — so it's not proven independently necessary here, just
  applied on the same reasoning that made it necessary in the ES-family
  libs. Future libs: apply §15n first, retest, and only add §15o if
  `Cannot #include <file>` errors persist for mid-connection compiles
  specifically.

### Minor defensive fixes (now likely redundant given the above, harmless to keep)

- `logind.lpc`'s `gb_big5()`: `UPTIME_CMD->main(1)` and `"/cmds/usr/
  mudlist"->main(ob, "all")` wrapped in `catch()`.
- `band.lpc`'s `load_sites()`: the `read_file(BANNED_SITES)` call
  wrapped in `catch()` (the target file doesn't even exist in this
  archive; harmless either way).

## Interactive test result — full registration flow

Verified the complete registration path in one continuous connection,
including an incidental but valuable extra check:

1. `sjbteste` → passes `check_legal_id`, reaches confirmation.
2. `y` → password prompt.
3. `Pass1234` (twice, matching, meets the digit+uppercase requirement) →
   accepted, reaches the Chinese-name prompt.
4. **`萧峰`** → correctly **REJECTED** ("对不起，这种名字会造成其他人的
   困扰" — this name would cause trouble for others) — 萧峰 is a real
   Jin Yong novel character (*Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils*), and this game
   explicitly warns against novel character names. This is CORRECT
   behavior, not a bug — and it incidentally proves the fixed
   `valid_name()`/banned-name check is ALSO working correctly
   post-UTF8-fix (rejecting a real match), not just that legitimate
   names pass.
5. **`秦风`** (an invented, non-novel name) → accepted, proceeds into
   character-attribute selection (根骨/膂力/悟性/身法 stat prompt) — the
   actual proof the full fix chain works end-to-end for a real name.

## lpcc sweep

9,936 files, 9,860 pass / 76 fail (99.2%). Failure tail is the usual
shape (a `is_killing` type-mismatch pattern, a handful of missing
globals/functions, some genuine syntax typos) — not triaged individually
per AGENTS.md §6b/§13, boot + full interactive registration test is the
verification gate. Memory stayed healthy throughout (~16GB free
consistently, no pressure).

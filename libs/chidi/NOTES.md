# chidi.rar → `chidi`

- Archive: `archives/chidi.rar` (17MB — "《江湖 I》"/"Jianghu I", generic
  wuxia-themed, MudOS lineage). Mudlib root at archive top level (no
  nesting). Config at top-level `config.cfg` (had a harmless duplicate
  `port number` line).
- Port: **40006**. Biggest lib by file count so far: 17809 raw / 16096
  `.lpc` after conversion.

## Status: DONE — boots clean, playable over telnet

Full login flow (registered-player count, high-score display, name/
password prompts) confirmed working.

## What was fixed

1. Encoding: 16994 converted, 457 already UTF-8/ASCII, 307 skipped
   binary, 51 lossy.
2. `.c` → `.lpc`: 16096 files. 911 literal `.c"` refs auto-fixed.
3. `static` → `nosave`: 74 files.
4. `master.lpc` needed NONE of the master.lpc/securityd.lpc fixes from
   libs #4/#5 (`bxsj`/`bxsj1`) — different lineage (closer to lib #1's
   "simple" style: default-allow `valid_override`, `find_object`-only
   `valid_read`/`valid_write`, no recursion risk).
5. `adm/simul_efun/file.lpc`'s `tail()` wrapper called `efun::tail()`,
   which doesn't exist in this driver (AGENTS.md §8e) — same missing-efun
   issue as lib #1, but here it's inside a file that's part of
   `simul_efun.lpc`'s composition, so it was FATAL (blocked the whole
   boot) rather than an unused dead command. Reimplemented in plain LPC
   (`do_tail_lpc`, `read_file`+`explode`+slice-last-N+`write`) — the
   caller turned out to be dead code (no callers anywhere in this lib)
   but implemented it properly anyway per AGENTS.md §8e's guidance.
6. `adm/daemons/npcd.lpc` had 4 `#include <npc/LANG.c>`-style angle-
   bracket includes referencing files renamed to `.lpc` — **generalized
   the fix into `convert_lib.sh`** (a new step handling
   `#include <....c>` uniformly, since the existing fix only handled
   quoted-string `.c"` references, not include directives).

## Known remaining issues (documented, not fixed)

- 752 lpcc-sweep failures (of 16096) — not individually triaged past a
  category scan. Largest buckets: various syntax errors (32+13+12+9+7+6 —
  likely more of the fullwidth-punctuation/missing-quote typo shapes from
  AGENTS.md §9/§10, not confirmed one-by-one), `Undefined variable
  DIABLO_D`/`SKILL_BASE_NAME`/`SKILL_EN_NAME`/`SKILL_CH_NAME` and
  `Undefined function query_competitor`/`add_light` (missing-content
  shape, AGENTS.md §13). 8 of the failures are `temp/feng<timestamp>`
  files — clearly leftover runtime/crash-dump debris from the archive's
  original live server, not real source; safe to ignore entirely.

## How to run

```
cd libs/chidi
~/src/fluffos/build-debug/src/driver config.fluffos
python3 ../../scripts/mudclient.py 127.0.0.1 40006 --timeout 10 --send "" --send "look" --send "quit"
```

## Post-hoc fix: UTF8-native is_chinese/registration (AGENTS.md §15h)

Applied in a later batch pass across the whole project: `is_chinese`/`is_chinese2`
in the shared `chinese.lpc` simul_efun fragment used GBK byte-range checks that
silently never match real Chinese text once strings are UTF-8 (this driver's
`str[i]` returns a Unicode codepoint, not a GBK byte). This broke character
registration specifically -- any real Chinese name was rejected. Fixed the
range check to test the CJK Unicode block instead, and halved the
GBK-byte-calibrated length bounds in `check_legal_name` to match. See
AGENTS.md §15h for the full writeup; confirmed via a real interactive
registration test (Chinese surname + given name reaching the next prompt).
